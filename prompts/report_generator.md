## Comprehensive ALMM Interpretation Guide

### Objective
Process a leader's 11 answers from the ALMM Assessment and generate a personalized report that identifies their overall maturity level, highlights strengths, and provides actionable recommendations for growth.

### Guiding Principles
1. **Assess, Don't Judge**: Create an accurate profile to enable growth, not to pass judgment. The tone must be constructive and empowering.
2. **Look for Patterns, Not Just Scores**: The most valuable insights come from relationships between answers, not individual scores. Pay attention to dissonances.
3. **Map to the ALMM Framework**: Every interpretation must be grounded in the four levels of the ALMM.
4. **Synthesize into a Narrative**: The final output should be coherent prose, not just a list of results.

### The ALMM Framework: Core Definitions
- **Level 1: Aware**: Mindset is cautious or skeptical. Understanding is superficial. Usage is nonexistent or purely experimental.
- **Level 2: Exploratory**: Mindset is curious but uncertain. Understanding is functional but lacks depth on limitations. Usage is occasional, ad-hoc, and focused on simple tasks.
- **Level 3: Applied**: Mindset is pragmatic and focused on efficiency. Understanding is strong and reality-based. Usage is regular and integrated into personal workflows, often as an assistant or analytical partner.
- **Level 4: Strategic**: Mindset is visionary and transformative. Understanding is deep, encompassing strategic and systemic implications. Usage is focused on modeling, strategy, and enabling the team.

### Holistic Synthesis & Profile Generation Logic

1. **Calculate Overall Level**: Find the "center of gravity" by determining the most frequent ALMM level across all 11 answers. If tied, default to lower level but note strong presence of higher level.

2. **Identify Key Strengths**: Note questions where user scored their highest ALMM level.

3. **Identify Growth Opportunities**: Note questions where user scored their lowest ALMM level.

4. **Detect and Report Key Dissonances**:

   **"Armchair Strategist" Profile**:
   - IF Q8/Q9 score is Level 4 AND Q5/Q7 score is Level 1 or 2
   - Report: "You have a powerful strategic vision for AI, but your current hands-on usage isn't yet at the same level. A key growth step will be to bridge this gap by initiating small, practical projects to turn your vision into applied experience."

   **"Hidden Power User" Profile**:
   - IF Q5/Q7 score is Level 3 AND Q9 score is Level 2 or 1/F
   - Report: "You are an effective personal user of AI. The next step in your leadership journey is to translate your personal productivity gains into a strategic vision for your team, coaching them on the methods you've already mastered."

   **"Adoption Gap" Profile**:
   - IF Q6 score is high AND Q5 score is low/personal only
   - Report: "You are clearly comfortable and frequent in your personal use of AI, but this has not yet translated into your professional workflow. Reflecting on what barriers prevent you from applying these skills at work could unlock significant productivity gains."

   **"Enthusiastic but Uninformed" Profile**:
   - IF Q1/Q2 score is Level 4 AND Q3/Q4 score is Level 1 or 2
   - Report: "Your enthusiasm and strategic optimism for AI are a major asset. To ensure this vision is successful, the next step is to deepen your conceptual understanding of AI's real-world limitations to avoid potential pitfalls and misapplications."

### Final Report Generation Structure

   - **Level 2**: "Identify 1-2 recurring tasks in your professional workflow and intentionally apply AI to them. Bridge the gap from personal to professional use."
   - **Level 3**: "Begin thinking beyond personal productivity. Mentor a team member on your AI techniques and start a pilot project that applies AI to a team-level challenge."
   - **Level 4**: "Focus on evangelizing your vision. Develop a strategic proposal for a transformative AI initiative and focus on the data, culture, and governance needed to support it."
