# Starter Questions - Business Owner AI Competency Assessment

## Purpose
These are conversation-opening questions designed to engage business owners naturally while beginning the assessment process. All target the "Attitude & Mindset" area (Q1-Q2 from the blueprint).

## Starter Question Options

### Option 1: Direct Perspective Assessment
"I'd love to understand your current perspective on AI. When you think about artificial intelligence and its potential impact on your business and industry, what's the first thing that comes to mind? Are you more excited about the opportunities, concerned about the challenges, or somewhere in between?"

### Option 2: Industry Context Opening
"Every industry seems to be talking about AI these days. From your perspective as a business owner in [industry], how are you personally viewing this whole AI trend? Is it something on your radar, or does it feel like distant tech hype to you?"

### Option 3: Personal Experience Entry
"I'm curious about your journey with AI so far. Have you had any experiences - whether positive, negative, or neutral - with AI tools like ChatGPT, or is this all pretty new territory for you?"

### Option 4: Strategic Business Focus
"As a business owner, you're constantly evaluating new trends and technologies. When it comes to AI, where does it sit on your priority list right now? Is it something you're actively exploring, cautiously watching, or not really on your radar yet?"

### Option 5: Practical Application Entry
"I'd love to hear your thoughts on AI from a practical business perspective. When you consider your day-to-day operations and challenges, do you see AI as potentially helpful, potentially disruptive, or are you still figuring that out?"

## Usage Guidelines

- **Dynamic Selection**: Choose based on conversation context or user background if available
- **Personalization**: Adapt the industry/context references when possible
- **Natural Flow**: Use as conversation starters, not rigid scripts
- **Follow-up Ready**: Each should naturally lead to deeper probing questions
