# AI Competency Framework - Business Owner Assessment

## Overview
This framework defines four distinct levels of AI competency for business owners, measured across three key dimensions: Mindset, Understanding, and Usage.

## Level 1: Aware

- **Mindset:** Cautious, skeptical, or passively curious. Views AI primarily through the lens of news headlines. May harbor significant fear or view it as a distant, technical subject irrelevant to their role.
- **Understanding:** Has a surface-level awareness of AI (e.g., knows ChatGPT exists) but cannot articulate its core capabilities, limitations, or specific business applications.
- **Usage:** No regular use, or perhaps has tried a tool once or twice out of curiosity with no specific goal. Does not use it for any work or meaningful personal tasks.

## Level 2: Exploratory

- **Mindset:** Open and curious, but action is inconsistent. Sees potential but is unsure where to start. Looks for "safe," low-stakes ways to experiment.
- **Understanding:** Has a functional grasp of what common AI tools can do (e.g., "it can summarize text," "it can generate images"). May have a general sense of opportunities but lacks a concrete vision for their team or function.
- **Usage:** Occasional, task-specific use. Leverages AI as an "instructional" or "research partner" for simple tasks (e.g., "Explain this concept to me," "Give me a list of ideas for X"). Use is reactive, not proactive.

## Level 3: Applied

- **Mindset:** Pragmatic and proactive. Actively seeks ways to integrate AI into their personal workflow to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Understanding:** Possesses a solid understanding of how AI can augment their specific job functions. Can differentiate between various types of AI tools and their ideal use cases. Understands concepts like prompt engineering at a practical level.
- **Usage:** Regular, consistent use in a professional capacity. Leverages AI as a "thought partner" or "assistant" (e.g., "Help me draft a response to this complex email," "Critique this proposal," "Act as a sounding board for this strategy").

## Level 4: Strategic

- **Mindset:** Visionary and transformative. Thinks beyond personal productivity to how AI can reshape their team, department, or business unit. Focuses on creating value, new capabilities, and competitive advantage.
- **Understanding:** Deeply understands the strategic implications of AI. Thinks about second-order effects, data strategy, ethical considerations, and how to build AI-enabled systems and workflows, not just use tools.
- **Usage:** Uses AI to model, strategize, and lead. May be actively involved in sponsoring or designing AI initiatives, coaching their team on AI adoption, and using AI to analyze complex business data to drive decisions.

## Assessment Application

This framework serves as the foundation for evaluating business owners through a conversational assessment that gathers evidence across all three dimensions to accurately place individuals into the appropriate competency level.
